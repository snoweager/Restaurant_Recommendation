Restaurant Recommendation System

This project is a Content-Based Restaurant Recommender System that suggests restaurants based on the similarity of cuisine type, price range, and overall ratings. It uses the TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity to find similar restaurants and displays the results using an interactive Streamlit web interface.

 Features

- Recommends similar restaurants based on a selected one.
- Content-based filtering using restaurant metadata (cuisine, price, rating).
- Clean and interactive web app powered by Streamlit.
- Built with real-world restaurant data from Kaggle.
